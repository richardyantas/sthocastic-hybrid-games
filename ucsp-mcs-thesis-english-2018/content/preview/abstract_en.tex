Switched systems are used in hybrid systems that are most common in engineering applications(\eg logic-dynamic controllers, internet congestion even physical systems with impact,\etc). Hybrid systems have been used to model several cyber-physical systems.

In This work, we propose a pipeline to solve switched systems, providing safety and optimal functions to different cyber-physical systems, we propose a solar water heating as a case of study.We evaluate our results comparing with traditional controllers. In addition, we present a system called UPPAL STRATEGO that will be used in this work.
