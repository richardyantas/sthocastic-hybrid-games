\chapter{Discussion and Conclusions}
\label{ch:conclusions}
The main objective of this work is to prove our methodology in hybrid systems such as \emph{Hybrid Solar Water Heating}, in the modelling process was necessary to simplify the equations in order to focus us in the general methodology. 

\section{Limitations and Future Work}
\label{sec:limitations}

\myparagraph{Get an most approximated solution.}
As we explain in Section 4, we are assuming lineal some behaviour variables in order to avoid \emph{Partial Differential Equations}.

\myparagraph{Massaging Machine.}
An interesting applications on future would be  to build a massage machine, it is associated to comfort and it has several modes of control.
