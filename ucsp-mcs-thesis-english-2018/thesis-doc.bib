In this paper, we present a consolidation of a method proposed by Fletcher and Kasturi, with a number of improvements to make it more suitable for graphics-rich documents. We discuss the right choice of thresholds for this method, and their stability. We also propose a post-processing step for retrieving text components touching the graphics, through local segmentation of the distance skeleton.},

	Abstract = {The Internet contains huge amounts of maps representing almost every part of the Earth in many different scales and map types. However, this enormous quantity of information is completely unstructured and it is very difficult to find a map of a specific area and with certain content, because the map content is not accessible by search engines in the same way as web pages. However, searching with search engines is at the moment the most effective way to retrieve information in the Internet and without search engines most information would not be findable. In order to overcome this problem, methods are needed to search automatically for maps in the Internet and to make the implicit information of maps explicit so that machines can process it. In this paper we discuss how maps can be found automatically in the Internet and moreover, how the content of maps can be interpreted automatically.},

	Abstract = {With the emergence of Geographical Information Systems (GIS), map acquisition and recognition have become hotly pursued topics, both by the industry and the academia. The paper presents a novel methodology for the extraction and recognition of symbol features from topographic maps. The method proceeds by separating the map into its constituent layers and then attempting to recognize the features in different layers on the basis of symbol-specific geometrical and morphological attributes. Text strings have also been separated. The output is obtained in the form of an `e-map' that is vectorized and hence is suitable for GIS. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system a simple database along with a query processing facility is constructed integrating the information obtained from the e-map and `some' user inputs. The methodology has been observed to perform quite satisfactorily.},
