\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}
In this chapter we present basic concepts that are needed to understand better our work. Section x presents definitions about the mapping of color and Section y details concepts related to geographic map properties.

\section{Final Considerations}
In this chapter, we have presented some concepts about the mapping of color and geographic map properties. Color is used as a visual channel in map visualizations, and the selected colormap type depends mainly on data nature. Furthermore, map projections are used to transform the Earth's 3D surface into a 2D plane.

Next chapter will present our image corpus and how it was created, also presents in detail the steps of our pipeline and their corresponding evaluation results.
